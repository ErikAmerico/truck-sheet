While recording the fuel level is optional, it provides valuable insights into fuel usage.

    While Truck Inspection, Equipment Inspection, and Final Review data are also saved to the database, there is currently no interface in the dashboard to review the full Truck Sheet—this feature is coming soon.\n\n

    In addition to reviewing data, users can manage fleet information directly from this interface. The "ADD TRUCK" button allows new trucks to be added to the system. When a truck is selected, this button transforms into a "DELETE TRUCK" button, enabling removal from the fleet. To prevent accidental deletions, a confirmation pop-up appears before finalizing the removal.\n\n
